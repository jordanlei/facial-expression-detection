# facial-expression-detection
Facial Expression Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks. Project for Machine Learning (CIS519) at the University of Pennsylvania.

For this project, we used a basic Convolutional Neural Network to detect facial expressions. There are two experiments outlined in this project: (1) Training and testing on separate subsamples (train on female faces, detect on male), and (2) train on peak expression and test on mid-level expression.

The facial expression database used was the Cohn-Kanade Database of faces, linked here: http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/
